                <p>Bitcoin looks to have turned the tide after suffering heavy losses earlier this week amid an over-euphoric derivatives market.
The number one cryptocurrency rose back above $50,000 early this morning, having suffered a double-digit percentage drop to as low as $45,000 from all-time highs around $58,000 around midnight UTC on Monday, according to CoinDesk 20 data.
Following the drop, the perpetual futures funding rate – the average cost of holding long positions on major exchanges – has declined to 0.02%. It had been signaling excess bullish leverage and scope for a price correction with a rise to a multi-month high of 0.13% earlier this month, according to data source Glassnode.</p>
