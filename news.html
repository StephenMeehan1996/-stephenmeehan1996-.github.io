                Bitcoin prices were headed for a sharp weekly rise on Friday, even as the cryptocurrency was facing some negative headlines tied to a major trading platform.
                Binance Holdings Ltd., the largest crypto exchange by volume, according to CoinMarketCap.com, was being investigated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to determine whether U.S. residents breached securities law by trading derivatives on the exchange, according to a report from Bloomberg News on Friday, citing people familiar.
                Binance hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing and the investigation may lead to no action.
                Binanance co-founder Changpeng Zhao has said that the platform adheres to U.S. rules and “has a strong controls to prevent its customers from laundering funds.”<a href = "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-price-under-pressure-as-binance-faces-probe-but-crypto-headed-for-16-weekly-rise-11615583614?mod=cryptocurrencies">Click here to read more</a></p>

            <p class= "col_detail">
         JPMorgan issued a note Thursday that bitcoin (BTC, +1.58%) could fetch a long-term price of $130,000 if its volatility continues to decline.
         According to JPMorgan, Bitcoin is becoming more appealing to institutions seeking low-correlation assets that diversify portfolios, Business Insider reported Thursday.
         The U.S. investment bank noted that high volatility “acts as a headwind towards further institutional adoption.”

                 <h4>What Is Ethereum?</h4>
                    <p class="col_detail" style="font-size: 1.3em; ">
                 Before we explore the benefits and drawbacks of investing in Ethereum, it’s only fair to talk about Ethereum and its place in the cryptocurrency industry where thousands of digital assets are fighting for dominance.
                 Ethereum is an innovative open-source blockchain technology that can support not only financial transactions but smart contracts and decentralised applications (dApps). 
                 Its native currency ether is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at the time of writing.
                 If you are a newbie, you may ask what open-source blockchain technology is - sometimes an overused phrase left without any clarification. Blockchain, also referred to as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), is a  decentralised platform (run by different computers across the world) that stores blocks of information in order to make transactions and stored data transparent. Open-source simply means that the platform is accessible, so anyone from any corner in the world can track data

                 <h4>Advantages of Ethereum</h4>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Well-known founder and an expanding developer community:</dt>
                            <dd>- Launched in 2015, Ethereum has managed to revolutionise the cryptocurrency investing scene pretty quickly. Though Ethereum is not the first cryptocurrency, ETH has become one of the most popular digital assets. The team behind Ethereum - particularly, young Vitalik Buterin - is loved by many.</dd>
                        <dt>Ethereum is decentralised:</dt>
                            <dd>- Perhaps one of the main pros of Ethereum investing is its decentralised structure. As stated above, blockchain technology is decentralised and transparent, initially created to offer an alternative to traditional banking systems.</dd>
                        <dt>Ethereum is more than a cryptocurrency:</dt>
                            <dd>Talking about advantages, we should emphasise the fact that Ethereum is more than a cryptocurrency. The platform supports smart contracts, dApps (or apps that exist on a blockchain), and numerous Decentralised Finance (DeFi) projects, which is one of the main advantages of investing in Ethereum.</dd>
                        <dt>Ethereum is attracting more businesses:</dt>
                            <dd>- Many big companies support the development of Ethereum, with Ethereum Enterprise Alliance being one of the leading organizations monitoring Ethereum. As the need for third parties is eliminated, more and more investors get into Ethereum investing.</dd>
